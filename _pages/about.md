I am logging my experiences and knowledge about Machine Learning, Software Engineering and Interesting Research Areas in
this personal blog.

**About Me**<br>
I am currently enrolled into MSc. Computer Science program at Lakehead University and I will be graduating in Fall 2024.

I have experience of almost 4 years in working as Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines Inc.](https://fusemachines.com) from December 2019 to August 2023, where my reposnibility included working on Production ML System, Distributed Computing and Optimization.

I have worked on Computer Vision Projects like Statistical Shape Modelling, Object Localization, Object Detection 
and Semantic segmentation, Face recognition and Facial landmark localization. Besides these, I have worked on NLP 
projects like Text Similarity, Named Entity Recognition, Text Classification and Data Mining. I have also created 
different customized solutions for Full Text Search on Unstructured data using Elasticsearch and Redis.

Before this, I have done internship as AI Engineer at [EightSquare Infotrans](https://8squarei.com/) where I worked on
Computer Vision Solutions for mobile devices.

My superpower is good listening and curiosity due to which I am able to learn alot from my talented colleagues and 
friends in-addition to my own learning path. I am a self-motivated and self-learner.

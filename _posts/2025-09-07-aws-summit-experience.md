I am a big fan of AWS Summit and I have been attending the annual AWS Summit Toronto since 2024. In my opinion, it looks more like a Tech festival in fall where you will have a chance to interact with newly launched software products directly from their developers, attend tutorials, conferences, games and networking opportunities with many engineers.

# My Experience
The AWS Summits in Toronto for 2024 and 2025 showcased the rapid evolution of cloud computing, with a significant shift in focus and technological depth year-over-year. While both events were centered on core AWS principles, the 2025 summit marked a clear pivot towards more advanced, AI-driven autonomous systems.

## Major Differences in Themes and Demonstrations
The overarching theme for both years was innovation on the cloud, but I observed that narrative evolved significantly from 2024 to 2025.

### AWS Summit Toronto 2024: The Rise of Generative AI
The 2024 summit was heavily focused on the practical applications of **Generative AI**, cloud, and analytics. A key retrospective from the event highlighted discussions and presentations centered around this burgeoning technology. Sessions explored the use of Amazon Bedrock to enhance customer experiences and how various industries could apply generative AI.

### AWS Summit Toronto 2025: The Dawn of Agentic AI
In 2025, the conversation matured from generative AI assistants to **Agentic AI systems**. The summit emphasized a future with less human oversight and more automation, with multi-agent systems capable of human-like reasoning. This shift signals a new chapter in cloud computing where workloads not only run on AWS but also make decisions and automate workflows in real time.

## Takeaways
I would recommend securing your ticket as soon as ticket booking is active as AWS Summit attracts many visitors and bookings might get full early. Similarly, always look out for registration for additional pre-events and after parties where you will get the opportunity to network with professionals and experts from different companies.
